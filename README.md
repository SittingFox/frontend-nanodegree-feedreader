Feed Reader Tester
------------------

Starting with a simple web-based application that included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/), further tests beyond the initial have been filled in based on TODOs left behind by the initial developer.


How to Use?
-----------

Open up the index.html file in your browser. You will see the feed reader application, with feedback from Jasmine on the written tests passing at the very bottom.

The tests can be found within the jasmine/feedreader.js file.
